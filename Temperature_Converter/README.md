# Temperature Converter
The Temperature Converter is a simple web application that allows users to convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It features an intuitive user interface with input fields for each temperature scale, and as one value is entered, the corresponding values in other units are automatically calculated. The clear button resets all input fields, and the design is styled using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality.







## Features

- Responsive Design: User-friendly layout adjusts to different screen sizes for better usability.
- Clear Button: Quickly resets all input fields to clear values with one click.
- Real-Time Calculation: Instant conversion of temperature values without the need for a submit button.
